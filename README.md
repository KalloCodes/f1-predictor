Small calculator for a game between me and a friend

Me and a friend watch Formula 1 races and started a predictor game, where getting an exact match is worth 1 point, and getting one position away is worth 0.5 points.
We tend to get 3-5 points for a race, and I was interested in seeing what the average score would be if guessing blind.
I created this calculator and the answer returned was an average of 1.95 points for complete blind guessing.
